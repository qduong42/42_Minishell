'$LANG'"$LESS$SHLVL'$PAGER' 

1) Auto close brackets means this expands to '$LANG'"$LESS$SHLVL'$PAGER'" which eliminates function of '$PAGER'
which means all variables expand.

NOT WORKING INPUT:
$'USER'$LANG    --> Fixed, deleting $ keeping quotes expanding $LANG
$'LANG' $"LANG" --> handled as deleting $ keeping quotes
$"LANG"$USER    --> handled as deleting $ keeping "LANG" and expanding $USER

PROBLEMS:
NOT HANDLED ERRORS:
| at end
$|

input crashes:
$
$<invalid name>


INPUTS:
ls -l -a | grep "$USER" | wc -l
"$LANG""$USER"$USER | cat -e | wc -c

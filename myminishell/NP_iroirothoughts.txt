'$LANG'"$LESS$SHLVL'$PAGER' 

1) Auto close brackets means this expands to '$LANG'"$LESS$SHLVL'$PAGER'" which eliminates function of '$PAGER'
which means all variables expand. ==> ERROR HANDLING

NOT WORKING INPUT:
$'USER'$LANG    --> Fixed, deleting $ keeping quotes expanding $LANG
$'LANG' $"LANG" --> handled as deleting $ keeping quotes
$"LANG"$USER    --> handled as deleting $ keeping "LANG" and expanding $USER

PROBLEMS:
long command/arguements writes over prompt -> Should go to newline and leave prompt untouched
NOT HANDLED ERRORS:
| at end
$|
-> Lets Handle unclosed quotes -> Just give error. Rest of code will still work fine. But this prevents problems later on

input crashes:
$
$<invalid name>


INPUTS:
ls -l -a | grep "$USER" | wc -l
"$LANG""$USER"$USER | cat -e | wc -c

BASH BEHAVIOR:
bash-3.2$ $'USER'
bash: USER: command not found
bash-3.2$ $"USER"
bash: USER: command not found
bash-3.2$ $'USER'$LANG
bash: USERen_US.UTF-8: command not found
bash-3.2$ $"USER"$LANG
bash: USERen_US.UTF-8: command not found
bash-3.2$ $'USER'"$LANG"
bash: USERen_US.UTF-8: command not found

UNIQUE BEHAVIOR = UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR:
echo hello > outfile | grep hello

QUESTIONS:

1) Typecast t_list struct? For e.g (int)&(current->content) for strchr(current->content[i], '=');
--Why doesnt it work?
2) Why t_list * doesnt need to be allocated but t_pipe struct needs to be? Possibly because t_list pointer points to node which is allocated.
But t_pipe * points nowhere. The size of the struct is not malloced anywhere.
>>>t_list * is allocated in ft_lstnew so it is also allocated malloc (sizeof(t_list));
3) Why does char *token persist even though malloc is only size of struct which is pointer, not for actual content? If token not used, 
why free kills it? because token is malloced by ft_substr :D
token is malloced by strtrim
PROBLEMS:

1) env resolver doesnt work for NAME:_ maybe it does because _env var is changed when entering program?
>>Does work, expectation was something else, but expectation was wrong.

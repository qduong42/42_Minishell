QUESTIONS:

1) Typecast t_list struct? For e.g (int)&(current->content) for strchr(current->content[i], '=');
--Why doesnt it work?
2) Why t_list * doesnt need to be allocated but t_pipe struct needs to be? Possibly because t_list pointer points to node which is allocated.
But t_pipe * points nowhere. The size of the struct is not malloced anywhere.
3) Why does char *token persist even though malloc is only size of struct which is pointer, not for actual content? If token not used, 
why free kills it? because token is malloced by ft_substr :D

PROBLEMS:

1) env resolver doesnt work for NAME:_ maybe it does because _env var is changed when entering program?

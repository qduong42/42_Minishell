Special signs: "     '     $     <      >      |    <<     >>   _(for variable NAME)    

DONT NEED TO HANDLED "special" symbols:

Error Handling --> Special characters one after another like <    > or <    |

TO THINK ABOUT:

MULTIPLE HEREDOC WITHIN 1 PIPE 
MULTIPLE APPEND?
echo d >a>b>>c -> TRUNCATE A & B AND APPEND TO C
MULTIPLE INPUT

INPUT:
cat -e <<LIM <a | cat -e <b > c >>c
